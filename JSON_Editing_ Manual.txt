JSON Editing Manual

JSON EDITING
Inside the "fields" array is a repeating template for the cells.
The template is:

    "title":"...words...",  
    "description": "...words...",
    "image" : "...url..."


To change the title of a cell in the top 10 find the "title" for that cell and edit the words inside the quotation marks 

Example:

        "title":"The Big Golf Outing", 
    Could be edited to show:
        "title":"Yearly Fish Fry",



CELL ORDER
It is important to note that the order the event is in the fields array will also be the order it appears on the app.
For example in the example below Walther's Golf & Fun is the cell shown at the top of the app.
Pete's Circus is the second, The Big Ice Rink is the third etc.



ADDING IMAGES
Before adding an image make a note of its name.
To add an image drag and drop it on the GitHub web page and click the "Commit changes" button on the bottom left.
After adding the image it should appear in the list of files on the GitHub repository.
Click on the image file's name, this will take you to a page showing the image.
Go to the top of the webpage and copy the ULR.
It should look something like "https://github.com/BoredomBusters/BoredomBustersPublicAppFiles/blob/main/YourImageName.png"
Paste the URL into the image url section of the JSON for the cell you want to edit

**Note** when the --> is used the old text is on the left hand side and the New/Edited text is on the right

Example of changing the image for the "Pete's Circus" cell
    "title":"Pete's Circus",  
    "description": "Come see the show!",
    "image" : "https://via.placeholder.com/150" --> "image" : "https://github.com/BoredomBusters/BoredomBustersPublicAppFiles/blob/main/YourImageName.png"

After exchanging the old image URL with the new add this text to the end of the image URL

    "?raw=true"

Here is an example of what that would look like
    "image" : "https://github.com/BoredomBusters/BoredomBustersPublicAppFiles/blob/main/YourImageName.png" --> "image" : "https://github.com/BoredomBusters/BoredomBustersPublicAppFiles/blob/main/YourImageName.png?raw=true"
